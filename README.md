For now it has only two options for encryption, *simple Caesar shifting* and *custom dictionray encrypting*.

`Caesar`
User can choose the shifting value then press _encode_, it only supports English alphapet encoding.
User can decode the encrypted no doubt.
User can copy the output.

`Custom`
User can write a password of 47 characters, which is very hard and not recommended, so they can generate a random password which is the main purpose.
